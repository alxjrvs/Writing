<p><strong>TWO</strong> 
We catch a glimpse of HUSBAND. He's aged, pushing 50. He's got grey around his temples. He maintains a lively spirit, regardless. He's currently teaching. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "Throughout history, there are..."</li>
</ol>

<h2>THREE</h2>

<p>We see his class. It is sparse. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "...Inconsistencies. For instance, can anyone tell me the origin of The Siren?"</li>
</ol>

<p>FOUR
The Class is silent. The kids are playing on their phones, laptops, etc. </p>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>FIVE
HUSBAND is discouraged. </p>

<p>NO COPY </p>

<p>SIX
HUSBAND has turned to write on the whiteboard. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "There are ... Four competing theories."</li>
</ol>

<p>PAGE 2 - SIX PANEL</p>

<p>ONE 
We've left the classroom. HUSBAND is narrating. Each panel describes an origin in a single image. In this one, A woman clutches a glowing child in a forest, surrounded by fairies. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "An aged explanation can be found in the "Forest Nymph" narrative. Found as a child by a widow, Raised to protect the innocent. This particular origin has lost popularity, as of late."</li>
</ol>

<p>TWO 
This time, we see The Siren as a fully formed Adult, Glowing over a cowering populace in a city. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      " One of the two largest competing origins is the "Fallen God" theory. The first hero of earth, she appeared as a survivor from another plane of existence, the same plane where all mystical forces find their origin. "</li>
</ol>

<p>THREE 
Pop-art style, a woman watches as a headband - the Siren's headband - has flown onto her head, the outline of the Siren's costume visible over her clothing. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "There is, of course, "The Chosen One" story. A mild mannered professional or some such is given a relic of a fallen world, and forced to accept her destiny of the heir of Magick."</li>
</ol>

<p>FOUR 
The Siren stands proudly, lines of power surrounding her. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "This is a fairly new one, the whole "Upgrade" thing. I don't give it much credence... something about nanobots, government program. I'm sure you all know more about it than I do."</li>
</ol>

<p>FIVE
HUSBAND stands, contemplative. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "So, my question is. Which is the right one?"</li>
</ol>

<p>SIX
HUSBAND stands, waiting for an answer. </p>

<p>PAGE THREE - SIX PANEL</p>

HUSBAND stands morrowfully, still waiting. </p>

<p>NO COPY </p>

<p>TWO 
HUSBAND Turns to write on the board.  </p>

<p>NO COPY </p>

<p>THREE 
HUSBAND is now writing on the board. Behind him, we can see the class. More importantly, we can see the cityscape. A small tear has ripped in the sky, and now the sky has been made red. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "Of course..."</li>
<li>HUSBAND      "...Because you did the reading..."</li>
<li>HUSBAND      "...You know that there is some evidence to support all four."</li>
</ol>

<p>FOUR 
HUSBAND has turned. He is (semi-haughtedly) discussing his class. He is cleaning his glasses.</p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "This could mean any number of things. Simple rumor, for instance."</li>
</ol>

<p>FIVE 
HUSBAND places glasses back on. Everything blurry. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "Of course,"</li>
<li>HUSBAND      "If you believe in such things..."</li>
</ol>

<p>SIX
We are now seeing Husband's P.O.V. The Rip in the windows of his class have gotten more dramatic. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "It could be some manner of rip in -"</li>
</ol>

<p>PAGE FOUR - UNIQUE</p>

<p>ONE 
We now see HUSBAND's worried eyes. </p>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>TWO 
An old photo, in a frame, of a younger HUSBAND with WIFE. Comfortable, Casual, not a glamor or action shot. Just a shot of them together. </p>

<p> NO COPY</p>

<p>THREE
Closeup on HUSBAND's grim face. Note: this will be a normal panels size, but centered, surrounded by black. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      "Go Home."</li>
</ol>

<p>FOUR 
This is a Long panel, the length of two of them. It should be a dynamic shot of HUSBAND running. He's pushing people over. The hue is red (as are the skies) and other people are clearly in panic). </p>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>PAGE FIVE - NINE PANEL </p>

<p>ONE 
The top row of these panels are divided into threes. The backgrounds should blend into one another (so that removing the frames would show a single image of the background, with Husband running in each one. Everyone else should be running the other way. </p>

<p>FIVE
Street sign. "Mill Pond Park". </p>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>SIX 
We see young HUSBAND looking at the sign, facing the opposite direction. It's a mirror panel to FOUR, but young HUSBAND is younger, stylings of a late twenties mid-eighties individual. Panels with young HUSBAND are slightly greyed out, to convey passage of time.  </p>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>SEVEN 
SEVEN through NINE are the same background as panels ONE through THREE, with minor differences to make sense of the era. In SEVEN, young HUSBAND is walking to the left of the page. As such, he only appears in this panel, back to panel EIGHT. </p>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>EIGHT 
This panel should be serene. </p>

<p>NO COPY </p>

<p>PAGE SIX - UNIQUE</p>

<p>ONE 
HUSBAND has turned around, in Shock. </p>

<p>NO COPY </p>

<p>THREE 
Closeup on young HUSBANDS face, in shock, looking skywards. </p>

These are similar to ONE-THREE On page five. They show the rescue of WIFE. In the first panel, young HUSBAND is desperately jumping forward to save her. </p>

<p>TWO 
In this one, we see young WIFE and HUSBAND, where HUSBAND is tackling WIFE out of the way of falling debris. </p>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>THREE 
Young WIFE and HUSBAND are now almost fully tackled. </p>

<p>NO COPY </p>

<p>SIX <br />
We're back in the present story. HUSBAND is scared, looking into his apartment from his doorway. </p>

<p>SEVEN 
Panels SEVEN through NINE show large glass windows, overlooking a city scape. There is clearly a battle going on. It is one continuous background divided by panels (as the themes have been in the last few pages). SEVEN just shows the skyscape. </p>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>EIGHT
Another skyscape, with WIFE standing in front of it. </p>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>NO COPY </p>

<p>PAGE NINE � NINE PANEL, ALTERED. </p>

<p>ONE 
WIFE and HUSBAND are embracing. We see WIFE's face. Her face, and back of HUSBANDS head take up most of the frame. </p>

<ol>
<li>WIFE:        ...They're going to...</li>
<li>WIFE:        ...make it not happen...</li>
</ol>

<p>TWO

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND:     No. They... they can't.</li>

<p>NO COPY</p>

<p>FOUR

<p>ONE 
Black panel. </p>

<p>TWO
We see HUSBANDs face, with some of the blonde curls of WIFE next to his face. He looks noticeably younger - hipper glasses, maybe facial hair. </p>

<p>NO COPY </p>

<p>THREE
This occupies the middle two of a six-frame page. It's the view from the window. Everything is calm and peaceful; there is no view of the battle, and the skyline is basically the same (perhaps some minor updates to show that things have changed. They must be subtle.) </p>

<p>FOUR 
We see HUSBAND holding on to WIFE closely. We still only see the curled hair. </p>

<ol>
<li>HUSBAND      ...Good.</li>
