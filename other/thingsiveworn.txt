##Things I've Worn To Make Myself Cooler##
### A Cautionary Tale ###
*By Alex Jarvis*

If you're reading this, you self-identify somewhat with a particular class of people, something it is all-too-easy to call a Geek, or a Dork, or a Nerd, or whatever empowered phrase you've decided upon. Attached to that moniker is a shared history of events - not exactly the same from person to person, but similar themes. Shyness. Social ineptitude. Obsession. Quirk. Oddness. All of it coming to brilliant and spectacular foreground in the light of puberty, junior high, and high school. Bask in the warm memories of being teased, marginalized, and lonely Saturdays between you and an Internet browser. No judgments made. 

However, you've survived. You rolled into college, your face cleared up, you learned how to talk to the gender you wanted to talk to and, maybe, things worked out. Now you're a promising young upstart, full of ideas and *chutzpah*. But somewhere, you're always reminded of those awkward high school years, and (no matter how desperately you've tried to snuff out all traces of your former life) those memories tend to manifest in one way or the other. Such as, Clothing. 

The Former Crestfallen can be susceptible to an “Eternal First Day of School” in their adult life. If you remember the First Day of school, you were always picking out outfits with your family, deciding subtly who *you* were this year. You left seventh grade a nerd, but this year, you'd come back a ... Skater. A cool kid. A Ladies man. A musician. If you were like me, you'd try desperately to craft your identity to a room full of faces, hoping that they'd understand who *you* were this year. Of course, everyone went through some version of this. However, I don't think it stopped after I got my diploma. I've seen many friends and acquaintances fall into the trap of First Day, myself among them. You're out with friends, and suddenly, **bam** - you've decided who you are now, because you finally saw the piece of clothing that completes it. You're going to buy it and wear it everywhere, *because that's who you are now*. Believe you me, audience, there is no one more susceptible to this thinly-veiled narcissism than your author. I've bought every accessory you can imagine, every ill fated token a reminder of another time I thought that *growing up* meant *being someone else*. Being confident in your appearance means being confident in you, not your clothing. More often than not, that means wearing *less* accouterments, not more.

Here is an incomplete list of the fashion mistakes that I've made out of maligned hubris. 

**1. The Fedora.**

God, it's promising. You've seen Citizen Kane. You've seen the Maltese Falcon. You want everyone to know that, should a crime occur, you are *all over it*.  Wide brim covers exactly as much as you want it to (e.g., just enough to drape over your eyes on a slight tilt). Don't get me started on the patterns - I mean, for the love of Christ, you can have two kinds of checkered arrangements on those things (one on the hat, and one on the band)! No one is going to mess with you - specifically, the *you* that wears *Fedoras*. 

The fact of the matter is, I have **never been in the company of, nor seen with my eyes, someone who looks good in a Fedora**. They are the fools gold of looking fly. They are cheap and sold at Hot Topic (two things, of note, that might appear at every item on this list). Everyone wants to be Johnny Depp, but I think that's probably an assumption bias. Johnny Depp looks hot in a Fedora, sure - but that's probably because he's Johnny Depp, a man who has talent and personality on top of decent cheekbones. He can get away with wearing the fedora. [You Can't](http://lonelynerdsinfedoras.tumblr.com/). 

 
**Instead, Try: A Haircut.** I promise you that there is a style to match the shape of your face that will make you look ~100 times cooler than even the most satin of fedoras. What's more, you'll look like *you*. You can be confident that *you* look good, not your accessories. 

**2. "Leather" Bracers.**

"Hm." You're saying to yourself. "I want to look like some kind of bad-ass - maybe someone who gets into fights - so as to signal those around me that I am cool. How best can I do that, *without* actually needing to be anywhere near bad-ass (because if I go outside I basically burst into flames)?" Enter, the Leather Bracer. In times of yore, they strengthened, fortified, and protected the wrists of laborers and warriors alike. Now, they are made out of low-grade pleather, contain superfluous straps, and are sold for under 20 bucks at a Hot Topic. What is it about the wrist that makes it such a power-spot for adult fashion errors? Perhaps it is another trait borrowed from our formerly teenage selves; how many of us sported the Wrist-bands, decorated with various logos and video game references? It was like a hallway full of would-be marathoners in my high school. 

**Instead, Try: A watch.** I know, I know - your phone has a clock right on there. Still, do not underestimate the fashion of a decent, simple watch. Something like the Timex Weekender - a really cheap watch with a simple, uncluttered design - can give you a touch of fashion on an otherwise naked arm. 

**3. The Vest.**

I love vests. There, I said it. They create a pleasing V-shape around the neckline, they smooth out some of the Internet-inspired fat on my torso, and - miracle of miracles - they contain pockets. *Pockets that can hold my stuff*. Do you have *any* idea how much *stuff* I actually have? Still, the vest is sort of a hit or miss fashion-wise. They can come in garish patterns, and - despite what I just said - don't really do much but accentuate whatever you already have going on in the chest department (which, for ladies, can be something of a plus!). Worse, really good vests are more expensive, meaning the cheap stuff is going to either fall apart immediately or be really, really unflattering. 

**Instead, Try: A Cardigan.** Cardigans are definitely 'in' right now - you can pick up pretty cheap and simple ones at your local Macy's. They are thin but warm, they give you the same neckline as the vest, and they may even provide extra pockets. 

That's not the only alternative, though. Vests aren't a huge faux pas, just **Wear them with appropriate clothing**. Don't wear a vest with a t-shirt, wear it with a button-down and a tie. It can make you look professional, whereas pairing it with casual clothes can make you look like you're trying too hard. 

**4. Fingerless Gloves.**

I... I can't. There was no defense for this. I'm not even sure what look they go for, other than "frostbitten fingers". They're just silly. "But my smart phone" yeah, yeah. You do not need them. They are silly. Just, silly. 

**Instead, Try: Gloves, with fingers.** Fingered Gloves? 

**6. Glasses.**

For those astigmatic associates of mine, take a break and skip forward to the next one. I am speaking entirely to those who, like me, where not "gifted" with abnormal sight. Woe is us, that we do not rely on easily breakable shards of glass to allow us to function properly. Glasses are hip, and yes, they might even make you look smart. But the plague is upon us, and her name is unnecessary eye wear. Put as simply as I can, *If you don't Need glasses, don't pretend you do* . Our bespectacled brethren may not have 20/20 vision, but they can see through your falsehood. This is one fashion accessory that is reserved for those who have earned it (by virtue of their broken eyes). 

**Instead, Try: Context Appropriate Glasses!** All is not for naught, however. If you really need something to cover your eyeballs, there are plenty of reasons to wear context-appropriate glasses. Going out for a drive? Grab some sunglasses, or even aviators. Cheap, authentic aviators can be picked up from military supply stores, and other kinds can be found at the mall (stay away from the cheap plastic at department stores, however). You can wear these wherever they are appropriate - which means, never, ever indoors. 

**5. Giant Belt Buckles.**

I've had this one in multiples. The Green Lantern logo. The Triforce. My Rap alter-ego. A deck of cards. An NES controller. A Working Lighter. The *Joker's Face*. Not a one of them looked great, especially when you consider that they are worn on a cheap pleather belt from Hot Topic (for those of you playing along at home, you may now drink). They have a lot to do with broadcasting your identity, but it isn't a good look. You should do that with your style, not your specific choice of clothing, and certainly not a gaudy belt buckle - but we'll get into that in another post. 

**Instead, Try: Simple belts.** This one is a no-brainier. A simple, non-studded, brown leather belt with a tasteful buckle will win every time. You do not want your belt to be too "loud" - you want it to do two things: hold up your pants and match your shoes.  


**7. The Graphic Tee.**

 I know. What I just suggested might be shocking. After all, the (generally ironic) graphic tee is the bread and butter of the modern disenfranchised fashion statement. Take a minute, come back when you're ready. The truth of the matter is: Most graphic tees are pretty terrible. They are noisy, distracting, and often, *ugly*. Think about band shirts; have you ever seen anyone in a band shirt that was *rocking it* (modern, design-conscious bands notwithstanding)? Noisy, distractingly, and ugly. It is a sad fact that a lot of graphic shirts - particularly those with text - fall into those categories. 

**Instead, Try: The Graphic Tee.** See? I wasn't going to leave you hanging. Simple patterns and designs on graphic shirts are much more permissible than large, text-heavy ones. A single color shirt is preferable, but simple designs are not horrible, and can look really nice with the right set of clothing to match. The less colors the shirt has, and the more subtle the design, the better. Check out this [Elephant shirt](http://www.threadless.com/product/2756/Elephant/tab,guys/style,shirt) from threadless as an example of the "less is more" strategy in action. 

You are not your clothes, and self confidence comes from how you wear what you wear, not necessarily what you are wearing. However, there is such a thing as a faux-pas, and they are easily avoided if you stop trying to look cool with quasi-hip fashion accessories. You can come off as desperate, and that just isn't a good look on anyone. Avoid these mistakes, keep it simple, and stay square.
