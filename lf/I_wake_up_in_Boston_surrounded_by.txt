I wake up in Boston surrounded by animals - this is always the case, there are always animals and Boston is always full of them - and there is something on my breath I can not recognize (Almonds and beer). My memories piece themselves together and a smile lurches across my face, like a needle scratching a record (Wanda Jackson, 1961, "Right or Wrong" B-side) and I am compelled to jump to my devices, and begin doing whatever this is. 


I'm told the animals - two cats, both black, one called "Major Major Major" and the other (if memory serves) is named "Jesus Christ" - are brothers, so what they are doing now is certainly offending some feline sect of catholicism. It's worthwhile background music while I clear my head of an afternoon of frivolity, frivolity that I hope to continue today (only for another six hours or so. Narnia is great, but Earth is home. Boston is a labyrinth that some get trapped in willingly. I'm anticipating it myself, eventually.) 

There are people in this world that I will die happy having known. The two that I am staying with - not the Cats, thoigh I'm sure they're good people, incestuous or not, I am not here to judge - are earnestly some of the best humans you could hope to have, so wrapped up in narrative and mystery that they hardly seem real at all. If no one looks at them, I wonder if they'd dissolve into a literal storybook (Her, a horror bedtime story for kids written by an Ex Convict, him, William Gibson's lost prequel to "ANATHEM"). I like to think it's why they keep each other around. Makes me smile. 

Sometimes you wake up to the sound of cat sodomy, tasting grains and forcibly remembering women whose hand you'd feel comfortable holding. And here you go, Falling Down, Down, Down.
