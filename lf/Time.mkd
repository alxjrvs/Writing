229 Goodale Drive. Three Bedrooms, two bath. Spacious backyard. One Old Bastard. Loving family of four. 

The latest storm made all the trees in Connecticut shed its heaviest branches. We had the Old Bastard, which I've spoken about [At Length](http://tktktk "Oak") here and elsewhere. Driving around you can see all the limbs of all the old trees, dragged to the edge, ready for pickup. This process was made all the more eerie by the downed power lines and resulting power outage. Lights only came on in the last 24 hours (by this writing), Internet still hasn't come back (The First World version of Lucifer's Bargain)
