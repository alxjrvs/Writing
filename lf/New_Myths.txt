The Pair

At the beginning of all things, there was It. It stood resolute against itself, knowing only itself, and nothing else. 

It spent eons staring at that which it could see. It examined the arms at either side of itself. It spent millenia looking into its right hand. 

In the right, It saw light, hope, and breath. The right hand moved and swirled, it fought and raged, it swirled and moved, it knew and it lost. It loved this hand, but grew bored. It spend another millenia looking into its left hand. 

In the left, It saw progress, strength, and speed. The left hand grew and shook, it taught and spread, it grew and shook, it hurt and healed. It loved this hand, but grew bored. In time, it grew bored of all things. It no longer wished to no itself. 

With might force, It grasped its right arm with his left hand, and its left arm with his right hand. With might and strength, it pulled both of its arms off. It began to dissolve into blackness around itself, its arms floating in the midst.  

Eons passed, before the courage
