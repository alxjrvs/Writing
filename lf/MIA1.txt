“DANZA MACABRE” 

=PAGE 1
	Play with paneling here. They should be kinetic. 

*PANEL 1 
	Opening shot of a Flower Bulb, not yet bloomed. A Rose? Sure, a rose. 

*PANEL 2
	We see a man running down the streets of New Tiajuana. He is a “Choir Boy”. 

*PANEL 3.
    Same man, looking back behind him as he runs. He is dirty and has spots of blood on him. He is, of course terrified. 

DEAD MAN: *PANT*...FUCKING BITCH

*PANEL 4 
        Short Panel, his foot hitting something to make him trip. Trip wire. 
        
*PANEL 5
        The man is now falling.
        
DEAD MAN: AAIIIII...

*PANEL 6
        The flower begins to bloom, very slowly.
        
=PAGE 2

*PANEL 1 
	The DEAD MAN has now turned around and put his hands up to defend himself. 

DEAD MAN: Mercy! Mer...

*PANEL 2
	DEAD MAN looks surprised. His eyes are not squinting anymore, he is more (but not completely) relaxed. 

*PANEL 3 
	We see DM’s perspective. Empty street. 

*PANEL 4
	DM Gets up. All is well? He’s standing in front of an alley, though. You don’t think...

*PANEL 5 
	Flower, Continuing to open.

*PANEL 6
    This is from the perspective of the alley. Think of it like we’re seeing through the eyes of the predator. 

=PAGE 3 

*PANEL 1
	These next three panels are framed similarly. They are a profile view of the DEAD MAN and the alleyway. This first one has him standing there. There are hints of arms sticking out from the alleyway. 
	
*PANEL 2 
	The next stage of the flower. 
	
*PANEL 3 
	The same as PANEL 1, excepty the man is gone. 
	
*PANEL 4 - x
	This is the build up to the big reveal. We're about to see MIA for the very first time. The biggest panel should have the Man's worried face, with a hint MIA behind it. Maybe just the eyes. Scattered around the panel, however, are tinier panels (literally inlaid - these are panels just sort of floating above the main panel. Two of them should be of the Flower. There should be ones of DEAD MAN's hands tensed up, the Machete to his throat, maybe small bits of MIA's facial design. 	

=PAGE 4
	This is where we Make the money. Full Page, MIA Holding the knife to his neck (from behind). Perhaps an outline of DEAD MAN's body to show her off. This is also where we put the title page and information.
