I dated a girl for a short time who was an Oracle. Or, she was Greek, at least. She claimed to be a direct decendent from the Oracle at Delphi. She would smoke something very strong, her eyes would roll back, and she would speak the truth at me for hours on end. We never had sex. We kissed every day. We were never not holding hands.
