Songs and the Women who've shown me them. 

In chronological order. 

-"Basket Case", Green Day, N.F. (Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it.)
-"Uptown Girl", Billy Joel, A.A. (And then i'll win)
-"A Mircale Would", Last Five Years, T.B. (And it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.) 
-"All My Loving", The Beatles", R.S. (Remember I'll always be true)
-"Chemicals Collide", Cloud Cult, R.M. (The way our chemicals collide)  
-"Born to Run", Bruce Springsteen, L.T. (It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap) 
- "We are beautiful, we are doomed", Los Campensinos!,  R.R. (Oh, we kid ourselves, there's future in the fucking, but there is no fucking future)
- "Funnel of Love", Wanda Jackson, K.M. (My mind is a blank, my head is spinning a-round and around us)
