The best thing about *Northlanders* is that there there isn't a trick to it. There's no shoe waiting to drop. It has a premise, and it sticks to it: Vikings, damn it. Do you need more? 

Brian Wood ( DMZ](http://OurDMZReview "DMZ") gives us a story about Vikings. The Vikings don't sound like vikings, sure - they talk with modern affectation and phrasing, but that's less of a quirk and more of a device to get to the story. I have no doubt a writer like Wood could give us flowery Thor-esque sentences on each page, but that would get in the way of the characters. We're getting all the dialogue translated in the page. I had originally heard this was the "gimmick" of the series, which couldn't be more hyperbolic. Wood is trusting us with this, putting it bluntly to his readers, **These guys are from a long time ago, you know how they talk, lets move past that.** So think of it less as "Oh, wow, vikings that sound like modern people!" and more that the babelfish has rooted in your brain. 

Of course, these vikings have the mouths of sailors. R rated, kids. 

The story is the Prodigal Son come home to a broken empire.
